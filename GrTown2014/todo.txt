Andrew McOlash and Jason Bernstein

Project Theme: Future City

Project Description: In this project, we added new and interesting buildings as well
as making hover cars and some cool graphical additions and new objects for the
graphics town world. These include surfaces of revolution, particle systems, sun
and moon, multiple shaders which added physical characteristics (physics) to
verticies, cool shaders for coloring/lighting, a skybox and interesting behaviors.

Todo:

X Spaceships instead of cars - Andrew / Jason
X Rearrange the suburbs a bit - Andrew

X Cool buildings/skyscrapers/houses - Andrew / Jason
- Police Spaceship
- Tweaking UI and controls to allow movement when following
- Cars stop at stopsigns

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fully Created Objects:
X Buildings
  X Cool one, egg, skyscraper
X Fountain
X UFO

Shaders:
X Pond Color Responds to time of day, also UFO
X Simple global lighting shader
X Billboard shader
X Sun Shader - time based with fancy math
X Procedural Texture - Moon, blurred noise (like clouds)

Behaviors:
X UFO Movement
X Sun / Moon Movement

Textures:
X Lane markers + Intersections
X Brushed Metal
X Textures wrapped onto surfaces

Technical Challenges:
X Particles
X Curved Surfaces (Surfaces of Revolution)
X Billboard (Sum/Moon)

X Modified ligthing to only use ambient at night (more realistic)
