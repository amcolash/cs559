Assignment 6

This project shows the basics of FLTK and OpenGL. It draws a few objects and allows you to rotate
them using Euler angles.

Carefully read the program, and comment the code as you understand each part.
I left out a lot of comments so you could get a feel for the program structure on your own.
Don't forget to answer the questions and take a screenshot!
